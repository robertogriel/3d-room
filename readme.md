# 3D Room

3D Room is an interactive 3D environment that you can run directly in your browser. Use the WASD keys to move around and the mouse to look around.

This project utilizes the `three.js` library.

To run the project, you need to serve it on a local server. You can use the Live Server extension in VSCode for this purpose.
